# **Code Quiz**

## **What did I do?**

In this hoemwork I was tasked with making a coding quiz challenge using the Web APi we had been learning
I decided I would use an assortment of array's to help with this as it would make it easier to select questions and answers
and then have buttons be generated for the different elements within that array and have that tick down as you answered
I would then Have a timer and highscore.
The user would be able to view the highscore and see what the highscore had been for previous attempts.

## ***Challenges?***

This was particularly challenging as I had significant Computer issues, requiring me to submit late and get new deadlines etc.
So far I understand How I will have this run, generate buttons based on the element, have a countdown timer, then deduct time for getting answers wrong, or keeping it as it is.

## ***Changes for the future?***

I will be continuing to work on this as my computer issues are now solved!
